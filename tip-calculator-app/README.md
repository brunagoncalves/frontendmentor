## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of CSS Grid and responsive design techniques and JavaScript. I particularly focused on controlling the grid layout at different breakpoints for optimal display on smaller and larger screens.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to further explore more complex layouts using CSS Grid. I also aim to focus on accessibility improvements, ensuring elements have clearer focus states and are fully navigable by keyboard.
