## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Through this project, I practiced building a responsive card component with CSS Flexbox. The project allowed me to reinforce my understanding of custom properties for colors and typography.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to further explore more complex layouts using CSS Grid. I also aim to focus on accessibility improvements, ensuring elements have clearer focus states and are fully navigable by keyboard.
